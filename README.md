# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This is a simple, yet classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to compete against each other by taking turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

- **Player vs. Player**: Two players can play the game on the same device.
- **Simple UI**: A user-friendly interface with a 3x3 grid.
- **Winning Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Option**: Players can reset the game at any time to start a new round.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the application:

### Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
3. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
5. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.
